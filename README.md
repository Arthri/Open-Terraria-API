# ModFramework.NET  ![Build](https://github.com/SignatureBeef/ModFramework.NET/actions/workflows/ci-build.yml/badge.svg)
A tool for rewriting .net binaries. Can allow rewriting of Types to Interfaces, Arrays to Extensible Collections, or even Fields to Properties.

It is built on top of [Mono.Cecil](https://github.com/jbevain/cecil) & [Mono.Mod](https://github.com/MonoMod/MonoMod), it aims to allow mod developers to change application logic without having to touch [CIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language) as much, yeilding much less technical code that most try and avoid.

### Examples
